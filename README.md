## 📖 Project Description (Easy to Understand)

The Voice Command Shopping Assistant helps users create and manage a shopping list using their **voice**.

### Example:
- User says: **“Add apple to my list”**
- The system understands the command
- **Apple** is added to the shopping list automatically

This project is inspired by real-world systems like **Alexa, Google Assistant, and grocery shopping apps** where voice commands are used for hands-free interaction.
